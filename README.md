# Take Our Kids to Work Day
We recently had a "Take Our Kids to Work Day" at iPipeline Canada. This is a day where children of our employees that are in grade 9 accompany their parents to their workplace to experience the environment. As part of this we quickly exposed them to what it is like to work on an Agile team.

# Super Hero Product
To support this agile concept we needed a product. Our product was creating a new super-hero. This super-hero would be defined by the team within the sprint and would need approval from our "product owner."

# Process
Prior to the kids arriving we had developed user stories and prepared our scrum board. Example stories included:
* As a super-hero I need a skin colour to be identifiable
* As a super-hero I need a hair colour to be identifiable
* As a product owner I need a social media presence so that I can market our upcoming super-hero

We quickly went through a video of Scrum concepts and assigned roles to the team; Scrum Master and Product Owner were employees. From there we quickly did sprint-planning, did some work, had a stand-up, did some more work, had a demo and a retrospective. All of this was in 30 minutes.

# What is this Project
This project was quickly developed (about 3 hours) to support the "social media presence" user story. The "model/hero.js" file is used to generate a JSON representation that is reflected on the root page.

As you modify the hero.js file the page will automatically reload and display all of the changes that you have made.

*Note:* This only currently works in Chrome, it did not work in Edge or Firefox.

#Starting the Project
After running `npm install` all you need to run is `npm start`
